                <p>During assignment two our group did alright. We weren’t completely dysfunctional, but we faced some problems. Most notably there was a lack of communication, it took a lot of effort for members to speak up and express their ideas constantly turning our meetings into long stretches of awkward silences. Another problem we faced was some members had unrealistic expectations of when they were going to complete their assigned tasks, making it harder to estimate how much work we need to do each day. The biggest problem our group faced was our time management. Due to everybody focusing on other assignments, we found the due date approached much faster than we expected, leaving us just over a week to complete the assignment. Despite these issues, our group was able to pull through and complete our work within a short time frame and we also had no infighting or any major issues with most of our members.<br><br>
                
                To remedy the issues we faced in assignment two, we have decided to implement a couple of strategies and ideas. To encourage more people to talk within our meeting we will have a new person take the initiative and lead during every meeting instead of one member doing it every time. To avoid awkward silences, we have decided to give everyone an order to speak, so we’re all not waiting on each other. To avoid unrealistic time constraints, we will make everyone show exactly where they’re up to during each meeting instead of taking their word for it, we will also more frequently check up on everyone to make sure they’re on track.</p>

                <p><h2 class="ITWorkHeading">William</h2><br>
                    I plan to gain proper skills and qualifications through university courses by applying for a transfer to computer science as this will allow me to deeply refine my abilities in programming and knowledge of how computers operate in general, before eventually taking a post-graduate course on cyber security. I aim to gain experience collaborating with others in these courses through group work and improve my social abilities through my current job working in retail.<br><br>
                    Similarly to Princess and Chelsie, I plan to develop my social skills through contributing to activities at university but a major difference between me and everyone else in our group is I plan to transfer to Computer science while everyone else intends to stay within the bachelor of IT course. Overall, we all share the similarity of wanting to continue a course within the IT field.<br><br>
                    
                    <h2 class="ITWorkHeading">Princess</h2><br>
                    I Plan to expand my knowledge on relevant skills for my ideal job as a web developer by completing my Bachelor of Information Technology course and improving my skills in learning more programming languages such as Java and JavaScript. I also plan to join more programs associated with this course such as the Cisco Mentor Me training, to improve my soft and hard skills, especially communication with others. Internship in the later years of my study to other networking companies is the best way to train myself as well as gain experience in both personal and professional work in my future career. <br><br>
                    I share a similar plan for most of the members by completing the Bachelor of Information technology except for William as he is transferring to the Computer Science program, other than that, we share the same plan of gaining more experience through job/internship and improving our skills on the IT industry throughout our study. <br><br>

                    <h2 class="ITWorkHeading">Chelsie</h2><br>
                    I plan to gain the proper skills and qualifications needed to become a developer by completing the course requirements for my Bachelor of Information Technology. In the meantime, I aim to gain experience in the IT industry through relevant jobs to build the skills needed and gain further understanding of what is required for the job. The course as well as the experience will help shape me into a more confident and qualified individual. <br><br>
                    The similarities I share with others is that they aim to gain skills through the courses provided as well as experience. The only difference is that Will plans to transfer to computer science while we intend to stay throughout. <br><br>

                    <h2 class="ITWorkHeading">Zachary</h2><br>
                    I plan to gain the relevant skills needed to become a programmer by completing a Bachelor of Information Technology.  In addition to this, I plan to intern at a data management company in the later years of my degree, once I have a greater skill base, to gain work experience in the field. <br><br>
                    All of us, except for William, plan to continue our bachelor of IT course, as well as planning to acquire an internship or entry-level job once our skills have developed. One of the only differences is that William intends to change course. <br><br>

                    <h2 class="ITWorkHeading">Tyler</h2><br>
                    I plan to get my qualifications through my university course and find a job in the IT industry whilst I am still studying as it would help me gain workplace experience whilst completing my degree.  This will help me out with having both a degree and time/experience in the field and allow me to grow in the industry earlier and find my way to where I want to be.<br><br>
                    The similarities I share with the others is that most of us are wanting to gain field experience throughout our time in our studies to complete our degrees with experience in the industry additionally. My difference is that I do not plan on transferring courses as Will does. <br><br>

                    <h2 class="ITWorkHeading">Overall</h2><br>
                    Across the entire group, everyone plans to learn and gain knowledge through their university degrees, and experience in different working environments. But one major difference compared to everyone else is that Will plans to transfer to a computer science course instead of staying within the bachelor of IT course. Overall, everyone shares the similarity of wanting to continue learning and working in the IT field.

                <h2 class="ITWorkHeading">Topic</h2>
                <p>
                    Our project is an interactive program that informs and then tests the users on basic cyber security practices. We plan to build a prototype of this program that users will be able to download onto a computer and then use to increase their knowledge of security. We have chosen to build this as a program instead of a webpage to allow it to be more modular. We will build this program using Python, and Pyqt5, a module that streamlines User Interface (UI) design and creation. The focus of the UI will be that it is simple and intuitive to ensure that inexperienced users will be able to successfully navigate the program without much trouble.  <br><br>
                    The lessons in the program will be designed using information that is drawn from credible sources, such as peer-reviewed journals, to ensure that the lessons are both accurate and helpful. Furthermore, the program will test users based on what lessons they have completed, with this feature assisting in finding the gaps in their knowledge, and areas where they might choose to repeat a lesson. To increase user retention, and achievement feature is used to ‘gamify’ the program and motivates users to come back to try and achieve better scores on the tests. 
                </p>
                <h2 class="ITWorkHeading">Motivation</h2>
                <p>
                    This project is useful because it will be aimed at teaching cyber security practices in an easy-to-understand manner to allow users of almost any level of computer knowledge to be able to use and understand the information contained in the program. “Attacks on the Internet of Things devices will increase rapidly due to hypergrowth in the number of connected objects, poor security hygiene, and the high value of data on IoT (Internet of Things) devices” (Sciencedirect.com, 2015, page 26 para. 2). This rise in attacks signifies a need to educate people who lack the necessary knowledge about tech and inform them of how they can protect themselves. This I especially imperative currently as a society become more entwined with technology, and inexperienced users are expected to interact with it daily. Working on this project would show future employers that the team member has a baseline understanding of python programming and user-centred design, can work in team environments and knows cyber security practices. 
                </p>
                <h2 class="ITWorkHeading">Landscape</h2>
                <p>
                    With the entwinement of individuals' financial and personal information into the internet, many organizations have resources for the public to help educate them on cyber security. One such resource is “cyber.gov.au”, a federal government website run by the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC). It provides information about cyber security to both personal users and commercial groups and has a quiz for users to see what level of knowledge the user has. This holds some similarity to our project, however, it also differs greatly, as it is a webpage as opposed to a program, and the testing component is more so about establishing the first-time user’s baseline knowledge as opposed to reinforcing lessons. Other than this, the market is remarkably bare, with most resources focused on people hoping to have a career in cyber security

        <!-- Detailed Description -->

            <div class="MainPanel" style="margin-top: 10px">
                <h2 class="ITWorkHeading">Aims</h2>
                <p>
                    This project aims to help enlighten people on the threats on the internet by teaching people all skills with technology. This will be done through a learning system with a quiz to consolidate the user's knowledge. The learning system will consist of both imagery and notes to read that are at the level that anybody can read the information no matter what level they are at with the imagery, this would also have to be readable so that it is not too complex for the average user but not so dumbed down that people get bored of the information that they are reading. The aim is for people to learn about the topics of online safety, privacy, social media/communication safety, device safety, and password safety so that they can make sure that they are taking the correct steps online to keep themselves safe from any dangers that these poses. The goal is not to protect but rather for people to understand how to be safer on the internet and have a good understanding of what they are doing and what they should be avoiding.<br><br>
                    A goal for achieving this is to make a basic prototype that shows what the goal and potential of the application are. Showing the potential of the application would then create interest in the application, especially for those who are looking out for new and upcoming applications or something that could be of use to them. This would help with people being able to give some pre-testing input so that the application can be more directed to them.  <br><br>
                    A testing phase would help with this goal as it would allow for relevant changes to be pointed out and fixed for the future. This also would be able to bring in the target audience for the first time to get their true opinions on how they feel about it. This would push for the application to allow for more inclusivity as it should be for all types of people and the more people that test would be able to show anything that is missing. It would also help with knowing whether the quizzes help with people's understanding of the topics or if the degree of difficulty needs to be changed on them. 
                </p>
                <h2 class="ITWorkHeading">Plans and Progress</h2>
                <p>
                    Our project is fundamentally designed around helping people keep their devices secure and informing them on how to identify and circumvent scams and other types of online misconduct. Additionally, we aim to provide detailed information for those who wish to refresh their knowledge on these security practices as well as people who have less than adequate general computer knowledge. Due to the large variety of users, we want to be able to have an effective experience with our project, all information within the project must be communicated in an easy-to-understand manner. We plan to implement this through simplified explanations on each topic and a focus on the user experience, eg. how the project looks and functions.<br><br>
                    Our project will achieve its purpose through the use of a program. The program is written in python and uses the modules PyQt5 and XML.etree. We chose to use Python for our program because it was the language our team had the most experience with, making it more time-efficient to learn the specifics that we would need for this project. We chose to use PyQt5 as it’s a highly customizable and robust UI module. It also includes a designer that can be used to visualize the entire program’s UI as we make it, resulting in a significantly shorter development period. We used XML.etree due to it being included in every Python install and thus, well documented as an efficient XML parsing module. \XML files were chosen to store basic data for each page and section such as the section name, the body (main text) of each page, each question relating to that section, and whether the section has been completed by the user. Storing this data outside of the main program, allowed us to implement some modularity into it. So instead of hardcoding each module, section and page into the program, we can cut down the amount of redundant coding significantly by making a shorter piece of code parse through the XML file for this information and using whichever pre-made layout, images or text that the XML file specifies.  <br><br>
                    Our program is split into three distinct areas. Firstly, we have the teaching area. This area of the program will include categorized modules, within which there will be separate sections and pages. Each module will cover a general security topic including online safety, privacy, social media/communications, device safety, and password safety. The teaching page communicates its information through short paragraphs of text with images displayed sporadically. Once an entire section is read, it will be marked as complete in the XML file.<br><br>
                    The second area of the program is the testing area. This part of the program gives the user several multiple-choice questions based on which sections have been marked as complete in the XML file. Once all the questions have been completed, the user is given their score and sent back to the main screen.  <br><br>
                    The final area of the program is the achievement area. This area will add a sort of gamification to the program to keep the user’s attention and give them some goals to strive for. This area will include various achievements that the user can earn in other areas of the app (eg. completing a certain amount of questions without getting one wrong). Whenever a user earns an achievement, they will be notified through a pop-up, regardless of where they are in the program and if they go to the achievement area, they will be able to identify which achievements they have and have not completed. <br><br>
                    We began this project by splitting it into two groups. The first group were given the role of a programmer while the second was given the role of UI designers. The programmers began their work by researching PyQt5 and learning that python module through YouTube videos, the Qt forums, StackOverflow and lots of trial and error within testing documents. The UI design team began by working on some basics for the wireframe and then presenting it during a group meeting. After this, they made changes where necessary and continued working. <br><br>
                    As the programming group progressed with the prototype of the program, we quickly noticed that due to time constraints and a lack of ability, we weren’t going to complete an entire working prototype. Due to this, we focused the development on the major areas of the program and split it all up into a few separate files for everyone to easily work on. The prototype file is the achievement area of the program. Here we used PyQt5’s Qframes as a visual identifier for which achievements have been obtained. The Qlabels and QPushButtons on the program have stylesheets applied to make them resemble the UI created by the UI design team. To simulate how the achievements would work, we placed some example buttons in the bottom-left of the UI, these buttons are purely for testing purposes and won’t be included in the final program. Once the program has noticed an achievement has been obtained, it changes the colour of the Qframe to green, the border will be removed through stylesheets, and a Qmessagebox is displayed that mentions the achievement to the user.<br><br>
                    <img src="Resources/none"><br><br>
                    For the teaching part of the program, we recreated the UI that the UI design team made in their wireframe once again through stylesheets. We placed a Qlabel at the top left of the program to indicate when an input is received from any section of the UI. The program uses a Qscrollarea to allow for scrolling within the program. In contrast to the other prototypes, this one uses Qlayouts to make each UI element relative to each other (similar to how you would use divs and floats in a website) This was required to get the Qscrollarea to work correctly. Upon scrolling down there are two buttons displayed that update the output Qlabel. <br><br>
                    <img src="Resources/none"><br><br>
                    For the testing section of the program, we mainly focused on functionality instead of stylesheets for appearance. A question is displayed as a Qlabel in the top area while each of the Qpushbuttons changes the output text Qlabel in the middle.<br><br>
                    <img src="Resources/none"><br><br>
                    For the XML prototype of the program, we created an example XML document that would represent what we would use for the actual program<br><br>
                    <img src="Resources/none"><br><br>
                    We then wrote a script to parse all the data we require for the functioning of the program. This function used the XML.etree.elementtree module to parse the data.<br><br>
                    <img src="Resources/none"><br><br>
                    The script outputs all of the data by printing it into the console. In the future development of our program, this data will be shown through Qlabels, QlistWidgets other UI elements. In our prototypes that focused on PyQt5, we made a base to build each prototype. This is shown below. <br><br>
                    <img src="Resources/none"><br><br>
                    We start by importing all the modules that will be used. Next, we create a python class as the Qmainwindow for the UI. The next piece of code changes the DPI scaling so it displays correctly on most devices (since some laptops have unusual DPI scaling, it can disrupt how the UI is displayed). After this, we announce a function for initializing the UI. Inside this function, a UI file created in QtDesigner is loaded and some short lines of code specify a function that connects to an element of the UI. These functions are defined below, and in this case, the Qlabel named lblOutput has its text changed. Finally, an instance of the program is created as a Qapplication and the app is executed. <br><br>
                    While the programmers partook in developing the backend of the program, the UI design team took up the task of working on a minimalistic front end. The decision to keep the program minimal was already established before the start of the assignment due to the concern that the program may come across as overwhelming for its target audience. This makes it easier to navigate and adds benefit to the programming team by making it easier to build. The design is made through Figma, a design tool, using standard laptops. Their team of two hosted one on one meetings held through Discord to make communication easier. As part of the brainstorming process, many ideas were brought up and then discarded when creating the basic mockup for the user interface. Plans for the mockup of the program were made before the actual process through low fidelity sketches with Adobe Photoshop to reduce the amount of time needed to correct mistakes. In Photoshop – which was streamed by a group member - the design team went through all the necessary design elements, including but not limited to the basic layout for the main pages and sections, where the buttons should go, the color scheme, and even the spacing of the features as well as accommodating for those with disabilities by incorporating accessibility options into the menu. <br><br>
                    During the actual process of developing the mockup, some concerns were raised which were missed through the planning process; the design team strayed from some parts of the plan to make necessary adjustments. They felt that the blue background of the program did not provide enough contrast against other elements since they are trying to accommodate those with visual impairments while keeping the program as minimalist as possible. The blue was then adjusted to be darker and richer, which contrasted well with the chosen shade of yellow that was used for the buttons, as well as the white for other elements such as the icons, menu, and text. <br><br>
                    The basic mockup was finished on Monday and was ready to be presented to the rest of the team. After a brief explanation of what the basic mockup looks like, a member of the programming team provided constructive criticism to improve the interface by suggesting navigation buttons to give the users the freedom to move around, as well as a ‘Scroll Down’ feature with a downwards arrow to show the users that there is additional information stored below the page they are currently seeing. The feedback was then considered, and the design team promptly added them. Only then did the design team realize that the sizes of the buttons were too large and took up the whole page which was then shrunk. They refrained from adding a login function after a quick read of the project plans; users need to store their progress locally through XML files, and if a login feature were added, the group would have to host servers which goes against what was established in the plan. Some problems required last-minute adjustments, with team members remembering to add necessary features, like the option to quit the program. Furthermore, the Test Your Knowledge section slightly differed from the testing section, as it was marked with a flag to see how much the user has learned by pulling random questions from random sections, they have gone through compared to the testing section where they’re asked about the topic they are in. After that, the design team kept working until the interface was polished and refined. <br><br>

                    The main page is the first thing users will see once they enter the program.  Here, they have the ‘Get Started’ option that leads to the learning module area, or the ‘Test Your Knowledge section, where they are given questions based on what they have learned. Miscellaneous elements are included such as a menu that gives them various settings – the most important being the accessibility option. The ‘shut down’ button is included due to the application of recognition over recall, an established usability heuristic so that users will recognize that it’s the button for when they want to quit the program. <br><br>

                    <img src="Resources/none"><br><br>
                    After a user clicks on ‘Get Started,’ they are taken to the learning page where they have the choice of where to start.  Once they are done reading through the learning section, they are then taken to the testing section where they are then assessed. If they are successful with completing the small quiz they’re given, they are taken to the Achievements section to see what they have achieved. <br>

                    In some instances where one of the members was unavailable to work on the design due to external reasons, another member filled in for them to maintain productivity. All tasks for this team were split evenly. The process overall took a slow start, but not dysfunctional since both the team members worked cooperatively. <br><br>
                    Some issues our team faced were primarily minor problems with python where some of the syntaxes were forgotten, typos were accidentally made, or indents were incorrect. Overall, the development of the prototypes went relatively smooth, and we produced prototypes for each major section of the program.  <br><br>
                    A notable decision we made for the project is we focused primarily on learning the python modules and creating the UI wireframe. Due to this focus, we didn’t place much focus on researching the topics for the project. <br><br>

                <h2 class="ITWorkHeading">Roles</h2>
                <p>
                    In our project, we have defined some general roles for each member to be a part of. We split the team in half, with one group being given the role of ‘programmer’, and the other the role of ‘UI designer’. Everyone with the ‘programmer’ role has been given the task of writing up Python code for the functionality side of the prototype. Everyone with this role has synced their IDEs to our GitHub and commits their code periodically. The code is focused on parsing from an XML file and basic inputs and outputs through PyQt5 in the teaching, testing, and achievement section. Members with the role of ‘UI designer’ are expected to create a mock-up of the UI within Figma which will accurately represent how the interface of the app will look. These roles are important because they divide our group and describe the category of tasks that each member has been given for the development of our project. Besides these roles, everyone has the role of project manager, we all update and make changes to our project-management tool Trello and check that everyone is on track with their tasks.

                <h2 class="ITWorkHeading">Scope and Limits</h2>
                <p>
                    The key objective of our project is to develop an interactive program that tests the knowledge of the users on basic cybersecurity practices and to inform people who are not as knowledgeable about technologies. This project is specifically intended for as many potential victims of cybercrime to teach them how they can protect themselves from fraud and cyberattacks on using the internet and devices in their everyday lives and how they can avoid further exposure to it in the near future. Due to time constraints and us still being relatively new to Python, our team have decided to limit our scope to a basic prototype that’s split into two parts. The first part is a prototype UI for our program that includes all the screen types that will be seen inside the program. We have agreed for it to be modular to avoid having to code every single page in the program. The second part of our prototype is the functionality behind parsing data from an XML file that we would have used to define the aspects of the modular UI and writing up basic UI in PyQt5 that includes simple layouts, inputs and outputs. For the UI prototype part, we are using Figma to show some of the key aspects of how we will initiate the teaching and testing part of our projects such as the information about the main page, the 5 teaching modules with the topics including online safety, Privacy, social media and Communication safety, Device safety and password safety. We will also include a testing aspect separate from the teaching section for users to test their knowledge. To show the functionality of our project, we are using the programming language Python and some of its modules such as PyQt5, and XML.etree.ElementTree. XML.etree is a python module that stores all the questions and answers associated with the topics that we will use to teach our users and PyQt5 are a module that is used to write up a UI for a program. We aim to test people on what they have learned and retain information by using gamification features such as achievements to make it more interesting and interactive for them. In making the UI of our project, we have decided to use Figma as we are familiar with its features of it because we are also using it in our other classes therefore it is easier for us to have a better understanding of how we would establish the UI of our project. We decided not to use the Google material design system as the UI designer team is not quite familiar with its features and it might take time for them to familiarize themselves to use it to design the prototype of our project.

                    Chelsie has proficiency with most of the tools including Python 3 coded through VSCode, GitHub, and Figma through the training she received in her courses, though she needs to gain an understanding of both PyQt5 and XML.etree.ElementTree through informal training that can be accessed online. She is self-taught with Adobe Photoshop due to her hobby as an artist.<br><br>
                    Princess can manage using Figma, GitHub, and python 3 as she also uses these tools throughout some of her other classes although she has not encountered them before pursuing to study this IT field. She is willing to gain knowledge and develop an understanding as well of the aspects of PyQt5 and  XML.etree.ElementTree through online learning. Princess does not have much experience with Adobe Photoshop and only knows little bits of editing knowledge through training with her dad. <br><br>
                    Zachary can use Python, Github and Figma due to training received in his course and has gained some knowledge in PyQt5 alongside QTDesigner through informal training. He still needs to develop his understanding of XML.etree.ElementTree, which can be learnt online. He has little experience with adobe photoshop but has used similar applications in the past.<br><br>
                    Will has some prior experience with Python and some common modules through high school and self-delegated coding projects. He has used XML.etree.ElecmentTree before but needs to go over some aspects again. Will has used the bare basics of PyQt5 alongside QtDesigner but has not delved into something too complex. He will need to research PyQt5 and learn more about it through the QtDocs, YouTube videos and testing within a coding environment. He has self-taught himself Adobe Photoshop before this course. <br><br>
                    Tyler has some prior experience in Python and Figma due to other classes in the Bachelor of Information Technology, and some tutorial youtube videos for extra learning with python. Needs to expand on more knowledge within PyQt5 which has been happening throughout the project. Have some experience with Photoshop as it was used in a year 10 class through high school.

                <h2 class="ITWorkHeading">Testing</h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to test our project through a couple of different methods. This includes periodic testing throughout the development of the different parts in the program, Eg. When a small function is complete, we will run the code to see if any errors or unexpected outcomes appear. Another method we will use is a testing table including different types of inputs for our program, the expected output and space for us to write in the outcome of each input and whether the program needs to be updated or the output is as expected. Our final method of testing is giving our Figma wireframe to others and asking them to go to a certain screen. We are testing the UI because ease of use to support a wide range of users is a must for our project. We will time our testers and note down any problems they encountered. The inputs on the testing table include integers, floats, strings, nothing, pressing a specific button, not pressing a button, etc. We will know we have succeeded once the program acts as expected and the testing table’s expected outputs match the actual outputs, and the users can easily find everything in the wireframe. <br><br>

                <h2 class="ITWorkHeading">Risks</h2>
                <p>
                    Our project idea concerns the arising problems of cyber threats that crawl their way into the digital world. We aim to educate those who are unaware of basic cybersecurity practices and fall victim to malicious software. However, several risks come with every project that is being built into fruition.<br><br>
                    Our main priorities for the project involve a minimalistic, easy to comprehend user interface. The target audience is those who are not as well versed with technology and need to learn how to navigate through cyberspaces safely. A problem with the front end is that some of the features may come across as niche or too advanced since it is difficult to put ourselves in our target user’s shoes, we’re entirely unsure how they would receive the program and its aesthetics, which might lead to our users disengaging with our program.<br><br>
                    Another problem that arises is the struggle of not being proficient in the tools needed to build the program. Our group members went through crash courses to learn PQt5 for the backend. With the lack of proficiency in the tools, some areas of the program will be relatively more difficult to explore and bring from the ground up. <br><br>
                    Bugs may also crawl through the program despite testing. While the backend may not have problems initially, some user interactions may cause errors in ways we have not anticipated. This can only be resolved through reports and updates in trying to find solutions to the problem. <br><br>
                </p>
                <h2 class="ITWorkHeading">Group Processes and Communications</h2>
                <p>
                    Our Group is expected to do a hybrid communication both in-person and online. This can take place at a venue that we have agreed on such as a library, cafe, or a private lecture room on campus. It is also expected that our online communication will always take place via MS teams, usually every Monday at 5 pm or whenever our group members are available and whenever they cannot attend in person within our time frame accordingly, though some group members especially the UI design team communicate through external applications such as Discord. When circumstances arise such as one of our group members not responding to communications, we should contact them via other university-related avenues such as their student email and ask them how they could continue to contribute to our team, but if this does not work and a week passes with absolutely no communication, we would let our coordinators know and see what we can do about that team member.

                    <h2 class="ITWorkHeading">Cyber Security Expert / Researcher</h2><br>
                    A Cyber security expert would be needed to further develop this project in the long term. This role would largely be focused on collating information about cyber security practices and creating lessons out of that information that would be displayed to users. This team member would have to be well versed enough in the topic to be able to simplify and explain cyber security concepts to a user who has little prior knowledge on the subject. Ideally, this team member should also have a degree of competency in visual design, as they would be tasked with creating visual aids, such as graphs, to assist in the lessons. Furthermore, they must have some experience in programming as they would be tasked with inputting the lessons into XML files, as well as editing those lessons that are already in that format, should the need arise.  <br>
                    <h2 class="ITWorkHeading">User Interface Designer</h2><br>
                    To finish designing the program, a user-centred designer would be needed. This role would primarily be involved with the creation of designs for further features and pages that may be added in the program’s future. To achieve this, they must be fluent in technical design skills, and have experience with designing mockups and prototypes of programs, using tools such as Figma. Furthermore, they would require a strong understanding of heuristic principles and common design patterns that ensure the creation of an intuitive user interface. Through working in collaboration with the user tester, they must beable to further improve the designs using the feedback given. <br>
                    <h2 class="ITWorkHeading">Programmer</h2><br>
                    With functionality being such a need, a programmer would be required to complete this program. The prototype in its current form is for demonstration purposes only, and as such, it would be the programmer’s role to ensure that the program becomes functional for users. To achieve this goal, they must be well versed in Python, as well as the PyQt5 and XML.etree modules. In addition to this, the programmer would need to help innovate new features for the program and be able to fix bugs and errors should they arise. For this, they would need the capacity for innovative thinking and problem-solving. They should also be experienced in working within a collaborative work environment. <br>
                    <h2 class="ITWorkHeading">User Tester</h2><br>
                    Due to the program’s target audience being those who lack experience with online technologies, it is imperative to gather user feedback to make improvements and add features to improve the experience. This would be achieved by a user tester. This role would include user testing of the program, through various means, such as lab tests and experience sampling, to gather user feedback. They must have knowledge of how to gather relevant user groups for testing. They would also be required to not only to have the technical skills to set up lab tests and create experience sampling questionnaires, but also to have a firm grasp of the ethics of user testing, to ensure that all tests are legal and safe for the subjects. After gathering the information from the observations and tests, the user tester must be able analyse and present the findings to the rest of the team, in order to facilitate a data driven approach to the improvement of the program.  <br>
